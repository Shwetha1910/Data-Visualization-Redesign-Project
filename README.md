# Data-Visualization-Redesign-Project
This project analyzes how long $1 million can last in every US state considering the Cost of Living Index (2017). Using R and various packages (ggplot2, plotly, usmap, dplyr, maps, micromapST), the project aimed to create easily interpretable visualizations for both analysts and laypersons. We evaluated a bad graph that poorly represented the data due to unclear visuals and misleading color choices. We chose a dataset with columns including Rank, Code, State, Cost of Living, Annual Expenditure, and Duration of $1 million. Starting with a dot plot and moving to an interactive bar chart, we identified the most and least expensive states. The final redesign involved a micromap and a US map plot, showing the geographical patterns and allowing users to hover for detailed information. Our analysis found that $1 million lasts the longest in Mississippi (25 years) and the shortest in Hawaii (13 years). The project's conclusion emphasizes the importance of good statistical functions and software like R for effective data visualization. Detailed steps and improvements, including the use of Plotly and micromap, are documented in the project report.
